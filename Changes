	* made __and, __or, __none aliases for composers

0.224 - Thu May 10 14:26:15 2007
	* Result.pm: check for handler key before using it

0.24 - Wed May  9 11:53:22 2007
	* Added a Brick::Result::Item class to provide methods to query
	the results
	* Programming errors caught by eval are now full-fledged errors,
	instead of silently ignoring. You can ask the result item if the
	error is a validation or programming error.
	* There are some broken composer things now that I've made these 
	changes, but I'm working on those.

0.223 - Tue May  1 17:48:27 2007
	* croak if we can't find a validator package, instead of just croaking

0.222 - Tue Apr 17 13:12:19 2007
	* The validation profile stuff now lives in it's own module,
	Brick::Profile. The methods that work on the profile (lint,
	explain) aren't in the Brick class anymore, so you need to
	either call them on a Profile object or use the Profile
	class name ( probably $brick->profile_class->lint( ... )
	* lint() still just takes an Array of Arrays because you 
	can't make a Profile object without passing lint. explain()
	still works with an object or an array.

0.221 - Mon Mar 26 02:04:40 2007

0.220 - Sun Mar 25 23:34:19 2007
	* Added a feature to set field labels and allow bricks to access
	them
	* Added the start of a module for bricks to deal with Files

0.2195 - Thu Mar 15 17:37:33 2007
	Added Brick::Result to handle methods to transform and format the
	data structure that comes back from apply()
	* Cleansed many tests to capture intentionally triggered warnings

0.2193 - Wed Mar 14 23:43:20 2007
	* Trying out some ways to extract the interesting error messages
	* Added failed_field and failed_value to die() hashes
	* Check out ./t/use_cases/top-level-errors.t for interface options
	for reporting errors.

0.2191 - Tue Mar  6 11:38:06 2007
	* Updated docs

0.2183 - Tue Feb 27 17:25:43 2007
	* The first CPAN release. Not much to say yet, but its easier for
	clients to grab this off CPAN than off Subversion.
	* This is alpha-software. Don't use it for anything because its
	going to change.
	* Read that last one again.
	* No, I really mean it. :)
